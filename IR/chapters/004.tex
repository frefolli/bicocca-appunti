\chapter{Named Entity Recognition}

\paragraph{definition} is the task of identifying the class or relationships between names in a text.

Example: <<Professor Pajeet doesn't speak very well>>; here, "Pajeet" is a \textbf{Person}.
Both POS and NER are tagging a sequence of tokens, but if POS works on the lexical level (recognizes grammatical syntax, like a Parser), the NER is working on the semantics level (recognizes roles, meanings, relationships, like a Type Checker).
