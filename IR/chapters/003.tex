\paragraph{POS}

Marking words in a text with the role in that sentence / text (ex: "chasing" -> "Verb", is" -> "auxiliary").
(TODO: Open/Closed class of words)
We need a reference for tagging: Penn Treebank has a set of tags which annotate a corpus.
The may be some ambiguity within a tense due to context which influences the meaning and role of a term.
Well, many words can only be assigned to only one TAG, others have a most-probable TAG which is by far the best.
There may be also correlations between a term being a TAG and another TAG/word appearing nearby.
Ambiguity is thus solved with probability and statistics.
